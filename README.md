Node.js and npm should be installed

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can open a terminal and navigate to your project directory. 
Then, run the following commands to create a new Node.js project and install the necessary libraries:

npm init -y
npm install express mongoose body-parser

Normailly this would install all the necessary packages but incase of any errors use:

npm install cors
npm install express

explicitly to enable the middleware for CROS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and to define routes, handle HTTP requests and responses, and organize your application into middleware and routing functions, oten used in combination with other libraries to build REST APIs, serve static files, and handle form data, among other things.
